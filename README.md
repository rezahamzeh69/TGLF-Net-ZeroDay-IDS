> **Threat-Aware Adaptive Representation Learning Network for Intelligent Intrusion Detection**

A research-oriented implementation of **TARL-Net**, a hybrid deep learning framework for intelligent intrusion detection, zero-day attack recognition, self-supervised representation learning, open-set recognition, continual learning, and explainable cyber threat intelligence.

---

## Overview

TARL-Net is a unified deep learning framework designed to address several major limitations of modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs).

Unlike conventional IDS models that rely on fully supervised closed-set learning, TARL-Net integrates multiple state-of-the-art AI techniques into a single end-to-end architecture capable of:

- Detecting known attacks
- Identifying previously unseen (Zero-Day) attacks
- Learning from unlabeled network traffic
- Adapting to concept drift
- Producing explainable security decisions
- Supporting early attack prediction

The framework was developed as part of a PhD research project in Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity.

# Main Components

## Hybrid Feature Encoder

The proposed architecture combines

- Transformer
- Bidirectional LSTM

to simultaneously model

- long-range dependencies
- sequential temporal behavior
- contextual traffic relationships

---

## Threat-Aware Adaptive Fusion

Instead of static feature concatenation, TARL-Net dynamically learns the contribution of each representation using a threat-aware adaptive vector gate.

---

## Self-Supervised Learning

To reduce dependency on expensive labeled datasets, the model performs

- Masked Traffic Modeling
- Contrastive Learning

before supervised fine-tuning.

---

## Open-Set Recognition

Unknown attacks are identified using a class-conditional Deep SVDD framework capable of distinguishing

- Known attacks
- Unknown attacks
- Benign traffic

without forcing all samples into predefined classes.

---

## Explainable AI

The framework provides

- Attention Rollout
- Integrated Gradients
- Confidence Calibration

to improve operational trust.

---

## Continual Learning

Replay Memory and Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) are employed to reduce catastrophic forgetting under concept drift.

---
